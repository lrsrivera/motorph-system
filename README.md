## üé® UI Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- **Primary Navy Blue (`#1e2a5e`)**: Based on MotorPH logo branding - used for primary buttons, headers, and key UI elements
- **Success Green (`#10b981`)**: Used for approved statuses, leave requests, and positive actions
- **Warning Amber (`#F59E0B`)**: Used for archive actions, resigned status, and warning states
- **Danger Red (`#ef4444`)**: Used for rejected statuses, terminated employees, and critical actions
- **Neutral Gray (`#6b7280`)**: Used for inactive states, end of contract status, and secondary text
- **Background Colors**: Light gray (`#f9fafb`) for panels, white for cards and modals

### Design Elements
- **Rounded Edges**: Consistent `border-radius: 8px` for cards, buttons, and modals; `6px` for badges and smaller elements
- **Subtle Shadows**: Soft box shadows (`0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`) for depth and elevation
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding (16px, 24px) and margins throughout for visual hierarchy
- **Typography**: Inter font family for body text, Poppins for headings - clean and professional
- **Icons**: SVG icons with consistent stroke width (2px) and 20px standard size
- **Transitions**: Smooth 0.2s ease transitions for hover states and interactions
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design with 768px breakpoint for tablet/mobile optimization

### Interaction Patterns
- **Hover States**: Light background color change (`#f3f4f6`) with subtle transform on interactive elements
- **Focus States**: Navy blue outline (`2px solid var(--navy)`) for accessibility
- **Modal Patterns**: Backdrop blur, centered positioning, ESC key and overlay click to close
